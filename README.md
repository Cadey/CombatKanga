# CombatKanga

One of the first ever NFT based games on the XRPL - Now opening up some of its tool bag to help other XRPL (NFT or not) projects work with XRPL SDK and Xumm SDK

**We will be updating this repo as often as we can. Open to suggestions for tools which the community would like to see implemented.**
**Contact us support@kombatkanga.art**

## Setup - NPM packages
`npm install xrpl -g`

`npm install from-exponential`

## CombatKanga utilities

### ckTools.js
For now a bit of a dumping ground for utility functions but will be cleaned up and turned into the main package

### TokenRichList
Our first utility script - Simply change the `currencyId` and `issuer` to your tokens currency and issuer wallet address to see yoiur tokens rich list!
